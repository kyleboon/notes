SUPPLEMENTS

â€“ Eat 30 grams (30g) of protein within 30 minutes of waking up. I know this isnâ€™t a supplement, but itâ€™s important, so Iâ€™m putting it here, since I think you might skip to this section. ðŸ™‚

â€“ Consider 1000mg of cissus quadrangularis before lunch.

â€“ Take 100â€“300mg of alpha-lipoic acid 30 min before dinner.

â€“ Take 3,000â€“5,000iu of vitamin D before bed.
