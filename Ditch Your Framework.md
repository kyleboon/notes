# Ditch Your Framework

## Introduction

My name is Kyle Boon. I'm a Lead Engineer at Target, and I've been here just over 4 years. Outside of work I live in St. Paul with my wife and 2 young daughters. They're 2 and 4 and might interrupt this presentation at any moment. That or the dog is going to start barking at the mail carrier.

My work at target is almost entirely on the backend. A good UX to me is just json and jq. So this talk will be mostly from the perspective of a backend developer, but I think the concepts are similar - from what little I know about the current state of javascript there are people in the frontend community discussing this as well.

## Tradeoffs


## What is a framework?
### Frameworks vs Libraries
### Features
### Dependency Injection
Pure depenency injection vs inversion of control 
## Composition over Inheritance
